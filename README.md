# Generate Prime Numbers
This simple tool written in C will generate prime numbers of N bits by generating a random number until it's prime.

## Compile
Just do `make`

## Usage
To generate the number `cd` to `bin/` and type
`./generate-prime <n>`
where `n` is the prime number's bits

## TODO
- Use threads for prime number test
- Use a BigNumber library
